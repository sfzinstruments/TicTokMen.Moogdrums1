Converted from the original GigaSampler version by S. Christian Collins

## Details

I created these sounds using the Moog Rouge synthesizer. 
The 79 samples are roughly broken down into the following sound groups.

3 - Clave
6 - Clicks
4 - Closed High Hat (solo)
2 - High Conga
2 - Low Conga
5 - Crash
7 - FX sounds (usable, thunks and bloops)
3 - FX Percussion (more thunks and bloops)
5 - Closed High Hats (paired with open hats below)
5 - Open High Hats
7 - Kick Drums
2 - Rim Shots
7 - Snare Drums
4 - Kick Drums (sub bass)
5 - High, Mid and Low toms (Note: There is not a "Mid1" tom.)
3 - Woodblock

All samples are clean and without effects or "sweetening". The recording path 
was from the Moog to an Event Darla and captured in Sound Forge.

Bit Rate: 16-bit
Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
Channels: Mono

The Gigasampler set breaks each octave (C1 to C7) into different drum groups. 
Commonly Kick drums are on C, Snares on D, Hi-hats on C# and D#, Toms on F, G 
and A, ect. Just use it, you'll get the picture.

Enjoy.
